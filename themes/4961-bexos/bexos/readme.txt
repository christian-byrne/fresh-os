	BeOs Inspired Cursors
	www.beos.com
	XFree 4.X Font Cursor
	I like BeOs! :)

	I'm going to build the new Cursors for Xfree 4.3

Test:
	it work on 4.2,
	tested on 4.2.1 Linux (NO DISTRIBUTION)		[GET SOURCE and COMPILE!]
	tested on 4.3 Linux (NO DISTRIBUTION)		[GET SOURCE and COMPILE!]


Install:
	this is a font cursor, this mean:
		- install as a cursor
		- remember to "remove" old cursor (cursor.pcf.gz)
		- run mkfontdir "dir where installed"
		- restart X (or try "xset fp rehash")
	* you may leave the font into your home dir:
		- mkfontdir "directory"
		- xset +fp "directory"
		- xset fp rehash

Patch: 
	See my patch.txt
