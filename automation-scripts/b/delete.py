Oh!\" groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looke daround .\n .\n .\n \"Bolkonsky!\" he whispered, his voice trembling from a a consciousness of the feebleness of age.\n \"Bolkonsky!\" he whispered, pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy, \"What's that?\" But before he had nished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of shamea and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to the flag.\n \"Foward, lads!\" he shouted ina voice piercing as a child's.\n \"Here it is!\" thought he, seizing the staff of the flag and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.\n Several soldiers fell.\n \"hHurrah!\" shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy flag, he ran forward with full condence that the whole battalion would follow him.\n And really he only ran a few steps alone.\n One solder moved and  aonther and soon the whole battalion forward shouting \"Hurrah!\" and overtook him.\n A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew's hands but he was immediately killed.\n Prince aAndrew again seized the flag and, dragging it by teh staff, ran on witht he battlaion.\n In front he saw our artillerymen, some of whome were ghting, while others, having abandoned their guns, were running toward him.\n He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round.\n Prince Andrew and the battlalion were already within twnty paces of the cannon.\n HE heard the whistle of bullets abnove him unceasingly and to the right and left of him soldiers continually groaned an d dropped.\n But he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front of him--at the battery.\n He now saw clealry the gure of ared-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while a a French soldier tugged at the other.\n He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they were doing.\n \"What are they about?\" thoguth Prinece Andrew as he gazed at them.\n \"Why doesn't the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why doesn't the Frenchman stab him?\" He will not get away before the Frenchman rememebrs his bayonet and stabs him.\n .\n .\n \" And really another soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realized what awaitred him, was about to be deicded.\n But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended.\n IT seemed to him as though one of the soliders near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon.\n It hurt a little, but the worst of it was the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at.\n \"What's this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,\" thought he, and fell on his back.\n He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended.\n , whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved.\n But he saw nothing.\n Above him there was now nothing but the sky--the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with grey clouds gliding slowly acorss it.\n \"How quiet, peaceful, and solmen; not at all as I ran,\" thought Prince Andrew--\"not as we ran, shouting and ghting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with the frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty innite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that innite sky.\n There is nothing, nothing, but that.\n But even it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace.\n Thank God!.\n\n\n"

	 "\n\nIn the rearguard, Dokhturov and the other rallying some battalions kept up a musktrey re at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops.\n IT was growing dusk.\n On the narrow Augusd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit on his tasselled cap peacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floudering silvery sh in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driver their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts--on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses' hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men disgured by fear of death now crowded togther, crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.\n Every ten seconds acannonball flew compressing the air around, or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and splashing with blood those near them.\n .\n .\n .\n On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkonsky bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.\n Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still.\n He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted.\n Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a bruning, lacerating pain in his head.\n \"Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?\" was his rst thought.\n \"And I did not know this suffering either,\" he thought.\n \"Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now.\n But where am I?\" He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking Frenc.\n He opened his eyes.\n Above him aain was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and between them gleamed blue innity.\n He did not turn his head and did not see those wh, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped near him.\n It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp.\n Bonaparte riding over the battleeld had given nal orders to streng the batteries ring at the the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the eld.\n .\n .\n .\n .\n \"That's a ne death!\" said Napoloen as he gazed at Bolkonski.\n Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was Napoleon who said it.\n He heard the speaker addressed as Sire.\n But he heared the words as he might have heard the buzzing of fly.\n Not only did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them.\n His head was burning, he felt himself blleding ot death, and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky.\n He knew it was Napoleon--his hero--but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignicant creature comparedw ith what was passing now between himself and that lofty innite sky with the clouds flying over it.\n At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently.\n He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound.\n He feebly moved his legs and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.\n \"Ah! He is alive,\" said Napoleon.\n \"Lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station.\n \" Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.\n\n\n"

	 "\n\nPrince Andrew rememebred nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.\n He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other wounded and captured Russian ofcers he was carried to the hospital.\n During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak.\n The rst words he heard on coming to his senses were those of aFrench convoy ofcer, who said rapidly: \"We must halt here: the Emperor will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners.\n \" .\n .\n .\n .\n Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.\n \"Which is the senior?\" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.\n They d the colonel, Prince Repnin.\n \"You are the commander of the Emperoer Alexander's regiment of Horse Guards?\" asked Napoleon.\n \"I commanded a squadron,\" replied Repnin.\n \"Your regiment fullled its duty honourably,\" said Napoloen.\n \"The praise of a great commander is a soldier's highest reward,\" said Repnin.\n \"I bestow it with pleasure,\" said Napoleon.\n \"And how is that young man beside you?\" Prince Repnin d Lieutenant Sukhtelen.\n After looking at him Napoleon smiled.\n \"He's very young to come to meddle with us.\n \" \"Youth is no hindrance to courage,\" muttered Sukhtelen in a failing voice.\n \"A splendid reply!\" said Napoleon.\n \"Young man, you will go far!\" Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his attention.\n Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battleeld and, addressing him, again used the epithet \"young man\" that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.\n \"Well, and you, young man,\" said he.\n \"How do you feel, mon brave?\" Thought ve minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes xed straight on Napoleon, he was silent.\n .\n .\n So insignicant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.\n Everything seemed so futile and insignicant in comparison with teh stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood, suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him.\n Looking into Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignicance of greatness, and the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain.\n The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the ofcers as he went: \"Have these gentlmen attneded to and taken to my bivouc; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds.\n Au revoir, Prince Repnin!\" and he spurred his horse and galloped away.\n His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.\n\n\n"

	 "\n\nThe soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's neck, but seeing the favour the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hasteneded to reutn the holy image.\n Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform.\n \"It would be good,\" thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icfon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, \"it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary.\n How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I should be if I could now say: 'Lord, have mercy on me!'.\n .\n .\n But to whom should I say that? Either to a Power undenable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but which I Cannot even express in words--the Great All or Nothing--\"said he to himself, \"or to that God who has been sewin into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important.\n \" The stretchers moved on.\n At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain; his feverishness increased and he grew dlierious.\n Visions of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night ebfore the battle, the gure of the insignicant little Napoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies.\n The quiet home life and peaceful happines of Bald Hills presented itself to him.\n He was already enjoying that happiness when that little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments had followed, and only the heavens promised peace.\n Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconsciousness and obligivion which in the opinion of Napoleon's doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.\n \"He is a nervous, bilious subject,\" said Larrey, \"and will not recover.\n \" And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of the inhabiitants of the district.\n \n\n\n"
