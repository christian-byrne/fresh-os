This is a CursorXP theme that I converted to a XFree86 4.2.99-4.3.x cursor 
theme, using a slightly modified SD2XC by ewindisch.

This theme *does* include the symbolic links that you need to make it work 
with QT/KDE.  Most of the common icons are included.


============= 


To Install
-------------------
As root:
Move untarred "vox" directory to /usr/share/icons/vox

Edit /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme to be:

[Icon Theme]
Inherits=vox

-------------------

As user:
Add to ~/.Xdefaults and/or ~/.Xresources the following:
 
Xcursor.theme: vox
  
Move untarred "vox" directory to: 
~/.icons/vox


These install instructions work for me on Mandrake 9.1 RC1.  I am not 
sure if other distrubtions are following these same configuration locations.  
Could people using other distributions post your successes or failures at 
using these locations.  It would be nice to be sure this is a standard.
