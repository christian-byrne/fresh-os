This is the "Red Dot Cursors" Cursor theme for XFree 4.3+
========================================================


I doubt that this could damage anything (unless you try to use them
under windows ;-)   ) but just in case:

Disclaimer: 
I won't hold responsible for any damage, problems, waste of time,
interference,.... (add whatever here)..... which this soft could cause.

========================================================

a)How to install:

Just type "make install"


b) To install the cursors including the old set of cursors by default:

Type "make install_old"

c) How to regenerate the cursors after a change:

Type "make" (or make install, if you want to install them straight)
